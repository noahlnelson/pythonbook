# This function numerically differentiates the array y which
# represents the function y(x) for x-data points equally spaced
# dx apart.  The first and second derivatives are returned as
# the arrays yp and ypp which are the same length as the input
# array y.  Either linear or quadratic extrapolation is used
# to load the derivatives at the endpoints.  The user decides
# which to use by commenting out the undesired formula below.
